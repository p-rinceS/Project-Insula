Grade distribution info is a great resource for students when picking classes, here are a few reasons why it can help:

- Knowing the grade distribution for a particular class giving students an idea of how difficult the class is, and whether it may be a good fit for them based on their own academic strengths and weaknesses.
- Grade distribution data can also provide insight into an instructor's teaching style and effectiveness. For example, a class with a high percentage of A grades may indicate that the instructor is relatively lenient in their grading, while a class with a low percentage of A grades may indicate that the instructor is more rigorous.
- Information can also be used to identify trends in certain departments or across certain subject areas, which can be useful information for students as they plan their academic path and select courses.


Please note that the bot is for informational purposes only and should not be used as the sole determining factor in selecting classes or instructors.
